# GitHub Actions Java Demo Project

Demo project for Java + Maven to run some tests on GitHub Actions and get the results back :)

Project created using the Maven Getting Started guide referenced below.

Running `mvn test` will run the test and should pass. Try running this in Github Actions and see what it looks like. Do the same using a VM and ensure it runs the test inside the VM and gets the correct result back.
